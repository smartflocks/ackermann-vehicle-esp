# PWM capture

The capture module in MCPWM peripheral is designed to accurately log the time stamp on the hardware side when an event happens (compared to GPIO ISR which requires a software-based logging method). Each capture unit has three channels, which can be used together to capture IO events in parallel but in the capture component we only use one channel per group

This example shows how to use the make use of the pwm_capture component hardware features to decode the pulse width signals generated from a RC radio signal

Typical signals:

```

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project or use the VS Code flash and monitor ðŸ”¥

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects or using the [VS Code extention](https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/basic_use.md)
